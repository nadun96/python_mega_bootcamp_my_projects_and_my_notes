Bug-Fixing Exercise 1: The program below intends to find out how many items have at least one underscore ("_") character in them.  However, there is an error with the code. Try to find and fix it.

ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]
 
x = 0
 
for id in ids:
if '_' in id:
    x = x + 1
print(x)
Solution

Bug-Fixing Exercise 1: The program below intends to find out how many items have at least one underscore ("_") character in them.  However, there is an error with the code. Try to find and fix it.

ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]
 
x = 0
 
for id in ids:
if '_' in id:
    x = x + 1
print(x)
Solution

ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]

x = 0

for id in ids:
    if '_' in id:
        x = x + 1
print(x)
-----------------------------
Bug-Fixing Exercise 2: This program also intends to find out how many items have an underscore in them. However, the program has a bug. It doesn't return an error message, but it returns:

1
1
2
Instead, the expected output is:

2

Try to fix the program so it returns the expected output. Here is the buggy program:

ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]
 
x = 0
 
for id in ids:
    if '_' in id:
        x = x + 1
    print(x)

Day 9, Bug Fixing Exercise 2
Explanation

Line 8 was

     print(x)

but it should be

print(x)

The print function should be unindented because we don't want to for-loop to call the function multiple times. We want to print the value of x after the loop as finished its iterations. 
ids = ["XF345_89", "XER76849", "XA454_55"]

x = 0

for id in ids:
    if '_' in id:
        x = x + 1
print(x)

Bug-Fixing Exercise 3: Fix the program below so it prints out "OK" when the perimeter is less than 14 and the area is less than 8. 

length = float(input("Enter length: "))
width = float(input("Enter width: "))
 
perimeter = (length + width) * 2
area = length * width
 
print("Perimeter is", perimeter)
print("Area is", area)
 
if perimeter < 14 and area > 10:
    print("OK")
else:
    print("NOT OK")

Day 9, Bug Fixing Exercise 3
Explanation

Line 10 was

if perimeter < 14 and area > 10:

but it should be

if perimeter < 14 and area < 8:


length = float(input("Enter length: "))
width = float(input("Enter width: "))

perimeter = (length + width) * 2
area = length * width

print("Perimeter is", perimeter)
print("Area is", area)

if perimeter < 14 and area < 8:
    print("OK")
else:
    print("NOT OK")
