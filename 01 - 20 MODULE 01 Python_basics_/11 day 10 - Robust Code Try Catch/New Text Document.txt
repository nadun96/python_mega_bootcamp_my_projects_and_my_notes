Q1: How would try-except work in a web app?

A: The try-except block would have the same structure if you used it in the Python code that creates your web app. The only difference would be that instead of printing the message in the command line, you would print it out in the web app interface so the user can see it on their browser. For example, if they enter a value in a text box and you know the value would cause a problem in the program, your try-except block would print out a message on the app page using specific functions that are able to display messages on the browser.
